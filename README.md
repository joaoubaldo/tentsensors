# TentSensors

## Description

TentSensors is the software component of a smart greenhouse
project. The code relies on MySensors library and implements a local
Gateway and Sensor Node (no radio needed) with the following childs:

* 3x relays
* 1x led
* 2x DHT temperature & humidity sensors

## Requirements

* See MySensors documentation for details but as of now only an Arduino Nano (328p) was used.
* MySensors Arduino library must be installed
